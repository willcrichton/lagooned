#   ACTIONS
# --------------------------------------------

ACT_MOVE_FOREST: Move to forest
ACT_MOVE_FOREST_SUCCESS_1: You walk toward the trees and find yourself in a dense rainforest. Frogs croak and the air hangs. Something is holding its heavy breath.
ACT_MOVE_FOREST_SUCCESS_2: The forest rustles at your approach. Your footprints sink into the mud and gnats swarm in great clouds above your head. There seems to be many paths to take.
ACT_MOVE_CAVE: Move to cave
ACT_MOVE_CAVE_SUCCESS_1: You find yourself at the opening to an enormous cave. The cavernous recesses echo your footsteps into infinitude. Ancient water pools at the entrance, beckoning you deeper into the yawning crevasse.
ACT_MOVE_CAVE_SUCCESS_2: You find yourself at the mouth of the cave. A pebble falls from a ledge and rolls before you. The depths are silent.
ACT_MOVE_BEACH: Move to beach
ACT_MOVE_BEACH_SUCCESS_1: You return to the beach and the ebbing shore. The wind blows salt in your mouth, and the sun braises your flesh.

# Scavenging / Foraging

ACT_FORAGE: Forage for food
ACT_FORAGE_SUCCESS_COCONUTS: "You shook a tree and a coconut fell to your feet. Lucky it didn't hit you."
ACT_FORAGE_SUCCESS_BERRIES: You discovered some berries in a bush. Ripe and full, they glisten in the light. Should you take the chance?
ACT_FORAGE_SUCCESS_SEA_GRASS: After finally getting a good grip, you yanked some slimy grass from the seabed.
ACT_FORAGE_SUCCESS_FLOWERS: You picked a bunch of sweet-smelling flowers with tender buds and pale freckles dotting the petals. Almost too good to be true.

ACT_BUILD_LEANTO_SUCCESS: Tired of sleeping under the moon, you build a basic lean-to shelter. The elements kept out, you can focus on less pressing matters.

ACT_SCAVNEGE_SUCCESS_LETTER: You find an empty envelope sitting in a stagnant pool. It falls apart in your hands, so you discard it.

ACT_SCAVENGE_SUCCESS_BUTTON: A cracked button stands out from the uniform ground. You ignore it.
ACT_SCAVENGE_SUCCESS_BOTTLE: You notice a clear glass flask wedged between a rock and a shrub. A long, jagged crack down the side renders it useless to you. 
ACT_SCAVENGE_SUCCESS_WATCH: "You see a bit of dull gold poking out of the water. Upon inspection, you see it's a pocket watch with the letter Q engraved on the back. You shake it and the parts within answer uneasily, so you leave it be."
ACT_SCAVENGE_SUCCESS_PEN: You stub your toe on a shiny protusion from pebbly shore. The culprit is a tarnishing bronze pen, the letter Q engraved in the side. Clogged with debris, it serves you no purpose.
